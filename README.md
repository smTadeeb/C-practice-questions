# C Programming Portfolio

A collection of problems and projects solved using pure C, written manually in a text editor without AI assistance. Demonstrates deep understanding of core programming concepts, memory management, and algorithmic thinking.

## üß† Philosophy

- **No AI Tools:** All code is conceived and debugged without AI assistance
- **Text Editor Development:** Written primarily in Notepad/plain text editors
- **Fundamentals First:** Focus on low-level logic and manual implementation
- **Concept Mastery:** Deep understanding of pointers, memory, and algorithms

## üìÅ Structure
All the cpp-questions are in cpp folder


## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- Manual memory management
- Pointer arithmetic
- Algorithm optimization
- System-level programming
- Problem-solving from first principles

*Code crafted with discipline, not dependencies.*
